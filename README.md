# About
!!!DISCLAIMER!!!
This autoclicker is NOT intended to be used to cheat in Online games, such as Minecraft. If you still want to use it for that purpose, bare in mind that you will most likely get detected, as the autoclicker was not designed with that intent in mind, and, for that reason, produces evenly spaced clicks, which are very easy to detect. Come on, just play the game honestly.
